## Problem 47 - Distinct Primes Factors

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

$\qquad 14 = 2 \times 7$

$\qquad 15 = 3 \times 5$

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:


$\qquad 644 = 2^2 \times 7 \times 23$

$\qquad 645 = 3 \times 5 \times 43$

$\qquad 646 = 2 \times 17 \times 19$

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each.
What is the first of these numbers?
